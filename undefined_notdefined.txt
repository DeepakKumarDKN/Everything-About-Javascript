var a = 7;
console.log(x)

so even before the first line gets executed in javascript the memory 
is allocated to a; 

javascript is trying to allocate memory to a even before the first line gets execute
and in the memory it will allocate it with a special keyword called undefined. 

undefined and not defined both are very diffrent from each other. 
if we are trying to acess something which we have not declared it at all 
there we will get notdefined for example here i am tring to access the value of x.
but have i declared x have i initialized any value to it, No i havn't so here 
i will get undefined.

in-sort i havn't allocated any memory to x. so if i will try to acess something 
which is not even allocated any memmroy then obviously i will get notdefined.

undefined is not equal to empty, if somebody tell you that undefined is empty
then its wrong.

its just like a placeholder its takes its own memory we will see undefined for only
that particular period of time untill and unless some value is assigned to that particlular value.

javascript is a loosely typed language why i am saying it as a loosely typed language because
for example i have saved something into a variable called data.

var data = "deepak";
data = 35; 

this is the reason i am saying it loosely typed because after saving "Deepak" into it
still i can change its value. but this is not possible in languages like c and c++.
