Var
----
= Var hamara old js mein tha.
= Var ek function scope hai .. aggar apne ek function mein var ko lekar kuch declare kiya hai 
ya phir kuch define kiya hai toh aap usko us function ke andar kahin bhi access kar sakhte ho
par us function se bahar access nahi kar sakhte.
= Var gets attacted to window object. 

example:
--------
function getData(){
    var name = "deepak"
    
    function getName(){
        console.log(name)
    }
    getName()
}
getData()
console.log(name) 
= Line number 20 this will give you error as i have said its a function scope but here i 
= am trying to access it outside the function which is not allowed. But yes i can make one more 
= function and i can access value of name there as well but not outside the function.

= var name; 
here we will not get any error here we will get undefined and undefined is a special keyword which we will learn 
while learning hositing and execution context.

var name = "deepak"
var name = "rahul"

= it allows us to reinitialize value into it. if we will console it we will get rahul as an Output.


Window object:-
--------------
js mein kain sare features hain jo ham use karte hain par woh features 
javascript laguage ka part nahi mein but still we can use it for example:
alert, fetch, document, setTimeout, setInterval etc etc if you want to know more then just go the the browser 
click on inspect and write window you will get to know a lot of things.

Let:
----

let is block scope. 

let username = "deepak"
let username = "deepak" 

line number 46 will give us syntax error as identifier username is already declared.
declare aap ek hi bar kar sakhte ho but variable aap change kar sakhte ho . 

let username = "deepak"
username = "rahul"
console.log(username) =>  "rahul"

Const:
-----
Jo chiz change nahi hota hai and const also block scope. 

const name; => this will give you error ham esko empty nahi chod sakhte hame 
kuch na kuch value dena hi padega otherwise hame error milega 
Missing intializer to const variable;

aap var and let mein chod sakhte hein apko wahan undefined milega but const mein apko dena hi padega.
=> we cannot update the value of const it is not allowed yahan bhi hame error milega. 
 TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.


function getData(){
    function getName(){
        let name = "deepak"
        const title = "kumar"
        console.log(name) => yes here we can access it. 
    }
    
    console.log(title) // cannot acces here, need to access inside the curly braces
    getName()
}

getData()
