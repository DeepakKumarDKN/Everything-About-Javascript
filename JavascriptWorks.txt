Everything is javascript happens inside the execution context.
Just assume the execution context as a container where the whole javascript program is executed.

Execution context is divide into two parts:
    1. Memory Component.
    2. Code Component.

Memory Component:
-----------------
in memory component everything got saved in the form of key and value pair.
key: value
a:10;
fn: {...} => the whole function will come and save here.
it is also known as variable environment.

Code Component:
----------------
=> This is where the code will get execute one by one.
=> This is also known as Thread Of Execution.
=> Synchronous Single Threaded that means javascript can execute one line of code at a time.
    after one line gets executed it moves to the second line that too in a specefic order.
