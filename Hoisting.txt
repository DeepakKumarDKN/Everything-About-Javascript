getName()
console.log(x)

var x = 7;
function getName(){
    console.log('namestey javascript')
}

Sop in this example i am trying to access getName even before initialized it
and we are trying to access the value of x even before we have initialized value
into it 

so in most of the programing languages we will get error here because it is
not possible but javascript works very diffrently and it is possible in javascript.


so in line number 2 i am trying to access the value of x even before i have
initialized any value into it so here i will not get any error but i will get undefined.
